# Next.js Portfolio Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Portfolio Project

This project is my personal portfolio, showcasing my work and skills as a developer. It is created with Next.js and uses the MagicUI components library for a seamless user experience. The portfolio is deployed on Vercel for optimal performance and easy management.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
